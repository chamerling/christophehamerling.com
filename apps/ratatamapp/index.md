	<p>RatatamApp is a <a href="http://instagr.am">Instagram</a> client for Mac OS X. Just forget your phone when you are in front of your Mac. RatatamApp notifies you when new photos are posted (<a href="http://growl.info">Growl</a> enabled). Just like and comment them from RatatamApp!</p>
	
	<p>Note that the goal of RatatamApp is not to have a better user experience and not to provide the same features Instagram does. The goal is just to have a minimalist interface to follow your contacts activity and to interact with them. That's all ;)</p>
	
	<p>RatatamApp is available on the <b><a target="_blank" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ratatam/id506361962">Mac App store</a></b> for $0.99 / 0.79 euros.</p>
